The artificial_random_signaling_network Github repo can help generate artificial random signaling 
networks by a Julia script Ground_truth_generation.jl with a set of parameters. Users can adjust
some of the relative parameters for biological insights and applications.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Using Julia script to generate synthetic signaling networks 
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. To use the Julia script, first install Julia by going to the Julia website (https://julialang.org/). 

2. Once you have the Julia console open, make sure you have "RoadRunner" installed by typing:

.. code-block::

   julia> import Pkg 

   julia> Pkg.add(name = "RoadRunner", version = "0.1.2")

RoadRunner.jl is a Julia package for the library of libRoadRunner that is used to provide SBML 
simulation support. Note that the dependency RoadRunner.jl is currently only applicable on Windows 
and Linux, so users cannot run the provided Julia script on Mac until an update from RoadRunner.jl. 

3. Follow the Julia warnings to install other necessary Julia packages if they have not been 
installed already.

4. Finally, download the Julia script from 
`GitHub <https://github.com/sys-bio/artificial_random_signaling_network/blob/master/Ground_truth_generation.jl>`_
into one folder. At the Julia console type: include("pathto\\Ground_truth_generation.jl") to run 
the main script. Note that "pathto" was the path where you saved the network generation script to, 
and the double backslash was to avoid Julia misinterpreting the backslash as a control character. 

5. A random signaling network would be generated in SBML format called sampleNetwork0.xml before the 
steady state and sampleNetwork.xml after the steady state. 

6. The Julia script was implemented in Julia 1.6 on Windows 10 with RoadRunner.jl version 0.1.2 for
all the results available on the repo.

---------------------------------------------------
Adjustable parameters for biological applications 
---------------------------------------------------

There were some configuration settings in the Julia script file Ground_truth_generation.jl. 
These included:
* The number of species "nSpeces"

* number of gene species "nSpecies_gene"

* number of reactions "nRxns"

* Randomly assigned ranges for species concentrations and rate constants could be modified via "rnd_species" and "rnd_parameter".

* "concentration_perturb" could be used to set the factor that perturbs the concentration at the input species. Default was set to 2.

* The number of random networks to generate could be set by changing the variable "sampleSize".


--------------------------
Default parameters setup
--------------------------

All the results are generated by the default parameter settings in the Julia script file 
Ground_truth_generation.jl. 

* The number of species "nSpeces"

* number of gene species "nSpecies_gene"

* number of reactions "nRxns"

* Randomly assigned ranges for species concentrations and rate constants could be modified via "rnd_species" and "rnd_parameter".

* "concentration_perturb" could be used to set the factor that perturbs the concentration at the input species. Default was set to 2.

* The number of random networks to generate could be set by changing the variable "sampleSize".
